# Generated BridgeJS Files

The files in this directory are auto-generated by the `bridge-js` plugin from JavaScriptKit. They provide the Swift bridge functions referenced by `@JSClass`, `@JSFunction`, `@JSGetter`, `@JSSetter`, and `@JS` macros in `Sources/WebGPU/Wasm/`.

## When to regenerate

Run the plugin whenever you change the `@JSClass`/`@JS`-annotated declarations in `Sources/WebGPU/Wasm/`:

- Adding a new `@JSClass` struct or `@JS` struct/enum
- Adding, removing, or changing `@JSGetter`, `@JSSetter`, or `@JSFunction` members
- Changing parameter types or return types on bridged functions

You do **not** need to re-run it if you're only changing non-bridged code.

## Command

```sh
swift package plugin --allow-writing-to-package-directory bridge-js
```

## Generated files

- `BridgeJS.swift` — Swift bridge functions with `@_extern(wasm, ...)` imports and protocol conformances
- `JavaScript/BridgeJS.json` — JSON description used by the JS-side glue code at runtime

## Why these files are committed

The `bridge-js` plugin is a development-time tool, not a build-time plugin. It does not run automatically during `swift build`. If the generated files aren't checked in, anyone cloning the repo would need to run the plugin manually before they could build the `WebGPUWasm` target.
